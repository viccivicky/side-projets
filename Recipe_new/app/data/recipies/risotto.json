    ],
    "instructions": [
        "To prepare your artichokes, trim the stems, and then peel them back to the inner, pale green leaves. Remove any hairy chokes with a small spoon, and slice thinly. The artichokes should then be immersed in a bowl of lemon water until you need to use them to prevent discoloration.",
        "Place the broth in a pot with the artichokes and keep warm. Heat the 2 tablespoons of butter, and oil in a heavy saucepan. Add the onions and cook until they are translucent. Add the rice and stir until it is well coated with the butter. Add the white wine, and stir continually over medium heat until it is absorbed. Start to add 1/2 cup of hot broth, stirring as it is absorbed. Continue in this manner, adding ladles full of hot broth, and stirring continuously for about 10 minutes, then add the artichokes to the pot with the rice as well.",
        "Continue to add broth ladle full by ladle full for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked, but remains slightly firm to the teeth, and the artichokes are tender. Remove from the heat, add the remaining butter, lemon juice, zest, and the Parmesan cheese. Stir in the chopped parsley and serve, offering additional cheese if desired."
