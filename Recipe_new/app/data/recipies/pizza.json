    "instructions": [
        "To prepare your artichokes, trim the stems, and then peel them back to the inner, pale green leaves. Remove any hairy chokes with a small spoon, and slice thinly. The artichokes should then be immersed in a bowl of lemon water until you need to use them to prevent discoloration.",
        "Start your risotto bianco and when you begin stage 3, drop 6 of your prepared artichoke halves into the simmering stock. Continue cooking the risotto, adding the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is half-cooked. Slice the remaining artichoke halves very finely and stir into the risotto."
